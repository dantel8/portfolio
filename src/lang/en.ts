    description: "Hi, I'm Dante Lugo, a frontend developer specializing in React. I enjoy transforming requirements into usable products, prioritizing performance, accessibility, and code maintainability. I complement my daily practice with my academic training—a bachelor's degree in computer science (4th year)—to balance pragmatic solutions with theoretical foundations. In my projects, I often use TypeScript for robustness, TailwindCSS for prototyping speed and visual consistency, and quality tools (linters, tests, and CI) to sustain growth. I am motivated by collaborative teams, continuous improvement, and challenges where a good user experience has a direct impact on the business.",
